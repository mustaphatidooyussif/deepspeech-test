Ghana	is	bordered	by	the	Ivory	Coast	in	the	west	Burkina	Faso	in	the	north	Togo	in	the	east	and	the	Gulf	of	Guinea	and	Atlantic	Ocean	in	the	south
Numerous	kingdoms	and	empires	emerged	over	the	centuries	of	which	the	most	powerful	was	the	Kingdom	of	Ashanti
According	to	the	2010	census	71	2%	of	the	population	was	Christian	17	6%	was	Muslim	and	5	2%	practised	traditional	faiths
Its	diverse	geography	and	ecology	ranges	from	coastal	savannahs	to	tropical	rain	forests
Following	over	a	century	of	native	resistance	Ghana's	current	borders	were	established	by	the	1900s	as	the	British	Gold	Coast
Ghana	was	already	recognized	as	one	of	the	great	kingdoms	in	Bilad	el-Sudan	by	the	ninth	century
Ghana	was	inhabited	in	the	Middle	Ages	and	the	Age	of	Discovery	by	a	number	of	ancient	predominantly	Akan	kingdoms	in	the	Southern	and	Central	territories
This	included	the	Ashanti	Empire	the	Akwamu	the	Bonoman	the	Denkyira	and	the	Mankessim	Kingdom
Although	the	area	of	present-day	Ghana	in	West	Africa	has	experienced	many	population	movements	the	Akans	were	firmly	settled	by	the	5th	century	BC
By	the	early	11th	century	the	Akans	were	firmly	established	in	the	Akan	state	called	Bonoman	for	which	the	Brong-Ahafo	Region	is	named
From	the	13th	century	Akans	emerged	from	what	is	believed	to	have	been	the	Bonoman	area	to	create	several	Akan	states	of	Ghana	mainly	based	on	gold	trading
By	the	19th	century	the	territory	of	the	southern	part	of	Ghana	was	included	in	the	Kingdom	of	Ashanti	one	of	the	most	influential	states	in	sub-saharan	Africa	prior	to	the	onset	of	colonialism
The	Kingdom	of	Ashanti	government	operated	first	as	a	loose	network	and	eventually	as	a	centralised	kingdom	with	an	advanced	highly	specialised	bureaucracy	centred	in	the	capital	city	of	Kumasi
Prior	to	Akan	contact	with	Europeans	the	Akan	people	created	an	advanced	economy	based	on	principally	gold	and	gold	bar	commodities	then	traded	with	the	states	of	Africa
The	earliest	known	kingdoms	to	emerge	in	modern	Ghana	were	the	Mole-Dagbani	states
The	Mole-Dagomba	came	on	horseback	from	present-day	Burkina	Faso	under	a	single	leader	Naa	Gbewaa
With	their	advanced	weapons	and	based	on	a	central	authority	they	easily	invaded	and	occupied	the	lands	of	the	local	people	ruled	by	the	Tendamba	established	themselves	as	the	rulers	over	the	locals	and	made	Gambaga	their	capital
The	death	of	Naa	Gbewaa	caused	civil	war	among	his	children	some	of	whom	broke	off	and	founded	separate	states	including	Dagbon	Mamprugu	Mossi	Nanumba	and	Wala
Akan	trade	with	European	states	began	after	contact	with	Portuguese	in	the	15th	century
Early	European	contact	by	the	Portuguese	people	who	came	to	the	Gold	Coast	region	in	the	15th	century	to	trade	and	then	established	the	Portuguese	Gold	Coast	focused	on	the	extensive	availability	of	gold
The	Portuguese	built	a	trading	lodge	at	a	coastal	settlement	called	Anomansah
Ghana	means	Warrior	King	in	the	Soninke	language
